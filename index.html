        <b id="c1"> Okay, can I just say something crazy? I love CRAZY!!!</b>
        All my life has been a series of doors in my face
        And then suddenly I bump into you 
        I was thinking the same thing
        'Cause, like, I've been searchin' my whole life to find my own place
        And maybe it's the party talkin'
        or the chocolate fondue
        But with you (But with you, I found my place)
        I see your face
        And it's nothing like I've ever known before
        <i>Love is an open door (Door)
        Love is an open door with you (With you)
        With you (With you)
        Love is an open door</i>
        I mean it's crazy (What?)
        We finish each others'â€” (Sandwiches)
        That's what I was gonna say
        I never met someone who thinks so much like me Jinx, jinx again
        Our mental synchronization
        Can have but one explanation
        You and I were just meant to be
        Say goodbye (Say goodbye) to the pain of the past
        We don't have to feel it anymore
       <i> Love is an open door
        Life can be so much more with you (With you)
        With you (With you)
        Love is an open door (Door)</i>
       <b id="c1">Can I say something CRAZY???</b> 
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Will you marry me?
        Can I say something even crazier? YASSSS!</p>
